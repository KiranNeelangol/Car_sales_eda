# Car_sales_eda
Analyzing and determining optimal market pricing for new cars using Python with Pandas for data analysis, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization

Car Sales Data Analysis – README
Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a Car Sales dataset using Python to uncover insights related to pricing, sales patterns, commissions, and other key performance indicators. The project involves data loading, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn.

The goal is to derive meaningful insights that can help understand factors affecting car sales performance and support data-driven decision-making.

Dataset Name: Car Sales Dataset
Format: CSV

The dataset includes fields such as:

Car Model & Year
Sale Price
Dealer & Region
Commission Rate & Commission Earned
Customer & Sales Details

This dataset was used to explore trends, identify outliers, and analyze sales and commission patterns.

Project Steps
1. Load the Dataset
Imported the dataset using Pandas
Displayed basic structure, data types, and column details

2. Data Cleaning & Preparation
Handled missing values
Renamed columns for clarity
Checked and corrected data types
Removed duplicates and outliers where necessary

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed detailed analysis using Pandas and visual tools to answer key questions:
How car prices vary by brand and year
Commission distribution earned by sales
Relationship between sale price and commission
Sales performance trends

4. Data Visualizations
Visualized data trends using:
Histograms & Distribution Plots
Box Plots (to examine price spread & outliers
Bar Charts (for categorical comparisons)
Line Graph (for pattern)
Heatmaps (for correlation analysis)
